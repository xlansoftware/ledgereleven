# Welcome to LedgerEleven

LedgerEleven is a personal finance application designed to be both a simple expense tracking app and a learning resource for developers. The project aims to provide a practical example of a modern web application with a C# backend and a React frontend.

## Project Goals

*   **A Useful App**: LedgerEleven is a genuinely useful, simple expense tracker. It aims to do one thing and do it well.
*   **Pragmatic Approach**: This project follows a "get the job done first, improve later" philosophy. The code does not pretend to be clean, well-documented, or to follow all best practices. This is intentional and leaves a lot of room for improvement.
*   **An Opportunity to Contribute**: The pragmatic approach means there are many opportunities to improve the project. You can help by:
    *   Extending the test coverage.
    *   Improving performance.
    *   Enhancing general code readability.
    *   Improve the user experience and visuals.
*   **A Playground for Contributions**: No aspect of the projectâ€”whether it's tests, features, design, or code quality is considered complete. This is by design. It provides a playground for developers to practice creating pull requests and contributing to an open-source project. We encourage you to create a pull request to improve any part of it!
