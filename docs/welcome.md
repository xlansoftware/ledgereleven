# Welcome to LedgerEleven

LedgerEleven is a personal finance application designed to be both a simple expense tracking app and a learning resource for developers. The project aims to provide a practical example of a modern web application with a C# backend and a React frontend.

## Project Goals

*   **A Useful App**: Beyond being a learning tool, LedgerEleven is a genuinely useful, simple expense tracker. It aims to do one thing and do it well.
*   **Learning Resource**: Provide a clear and well-documented codebase that can be used to learn about modern web development practices.
*   **Best Practices**: Demonstrate best practices for building a web application, including testing, security, and deployment.
*   **Extensibility**: The project is designed to be extensible, allowing developers to add new features and functionality.
*   **A Playground for Contributions**: No aspect of the project—whether it's tests, features, design, or code quality—is considered complete. This is by design. It provides a playground for developers to practice creating pull requests and contributing to an open-source project. We encourage you to create a pull request to improve any part of it!
