# Code of Conduct

## Our Philosophy

Welcome to LedgerEleven! This project is as much about learning to develop great software as it is about the software itself. We're building a community where everyone feels welcome to learn, experiment, and grow. Our primary goal is to have fun building something cool together.

## Our Pledge

We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching, and creating. We pledge to make participation in our community a positive experience for everyone.

## How to Contribute

We encourage you to contribute in any way you like. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or just asking a question, your input is valuable.

However, please understand that not all contributions will be merged. This is a learning project, and sometimes we might decide to go in a different direction. Please don't be discouraged if your contribution isn't accepted. The process of creating it is a valuable learning experience in itself.

## Our Expectations

*   **Have Fun:** This is the most important rule. Enjoy the process of creating and collaborating.
*   **Be Respectful:** Don't ruin the fun for others. Treat everyone with respect. Healthy debates are encouraged, but personal attacks are not.
*   **Embrace Mistakes:** We all make them! This is a learning environment. Be open to feedback, and don't be afraid to ask for help. Learning from our mistakes is a key part of the development process.
*   **Be Collaborative:** Work together. Share your knowledge and be open to learning from others.

**Let's have fun and build something amazing together!**
